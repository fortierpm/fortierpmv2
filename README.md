# fortierpm.github.io

This repository functions as the host for Peter Fortier's static hobby site. Github Pages is active, hosting the web page at the public url: https://fortierpm.github.io/. While mainly simple html and css is used, Jekyll—automatically enabled through Github Pages—is also used to simplify repeated code snippet organization. As Peter learns cleaner and more modern coding etiquette, he will update and improve this site.
